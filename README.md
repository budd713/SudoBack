# SudokuBacktracking

# Project name: Sudoku Puzzle & Solver

9x9 Sudoku puzzle with GUI that allows user to pencil in and erase unlimited moves. Pressing the space bar engages a backtracking algorithm that solves the puzzle step by step for the user. 

This is my first personal coding project outside of school and it has been a great opportunity to better understand the basics of Python as well as a rudimentary GUI.

## Usage:

This game was built using Python 3 with Pygame. If you do not have these then you will need to install them.

[Python](https://www.python.org/)

Install Pygame:
`python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`

Otherwise, the executable can be played regardless of platform.

### When you run the program, the GUI will appear:

Click on the cell in which you wish to write, and its border will highlight red.

Using either the QWERTY or numpad, type the number you wish to pencil in. To submit, press the return or enter key. Otherwise, you can leave it penciled in and return later to edit and submit.

You can pencil in several answers before submitting each one.

An “X” is marked at the bottom-left of the window for each incorrect answer submitted. You have unlimited tries to get the correct answer.

If the submitted answer is correct, the answer will remain boldfaced and centered in the cell and can no longer be changed.

If you no longer wish to work the puzzle, but want to find the answer, press the space bar, and sit back while the answer unfolds cell-by-cell using a backtracking algorithm.

Once the algorithm is finished, you will be able to view the entire solved puzzle. Press esc or click the x in the top-right corner to exit the program.
